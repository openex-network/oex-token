# OpenEX Token Contract Repository

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the OpenEX Token contracts! Our approach to blockchain development is grounded in principles of minimalism and decentralization. We're committed to creating token contracts that are secure, transparent, and free from centralized control mechanisms.

## 🚀 About OpenEX Token

OpenEX Token is designed with simplicity and security at its core. Our philosophy is to maintain the integrity of the contract layer by avoiding unnecessary complexity and removing management permissions. This ensures the highest level of security and trust in the OpenEX ecosystem.

## 🔐 Security and Audit

The security of our contracts is paramount. We have submitted all of our contracts for thorough auditing by a reputable third-party security firm. The audit process is crucial to ensuring that our contracts are safe and free from vulnerabilities. **Until the audit is complete and reviewed, we will not deploy any contracts on the mainnet.** Please be cautious and do not trust any contracts claiming to be the official OpenEX Token on the mainnet before our official announcement.

## 📦 Contract Features

- **Token Contract:** Our token contract follows the ERC20 standard, emphasizing minimalism. It is designed without administrative permissions, ensuring that no central party has control over the token's functionality.

- **Locking & Staking:** To support tokenomics that involve token locking and staking, separate contracts will be utilized. These contracts will also adhere to our minimalist philosophy, focusing on security and efficiency.

## 🚧 Development Status

The current stage of development focuses on finalizing the contracts and preparing for the security audit. Future updates will include the development and deployment of locking and staking contracts, following the same principles of simplicity and security.

## 🛠 Development Tools

We use the following tools and technologies in the development of our contracts:

- Solidity for smart contract development.
- Hardhat for compiling, testing, and deploying our contracts.
- OpenZeppelin Contracts for secure, standard contract implementations.

## 📋 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! If you have suggestions, improvements, or find any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines provided in this repository.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The deployment of the OpenEX Token contracts on any network, especially the mainnet, will be announced officially. Until then, any claims of such deployments are fraudulent and should be reported to our team.
